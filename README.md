To build a shopping list where users can add new items to the list that they'd like to get from the store and delete items from the list.

How to build it
This project will teach you how to add new items to an array in our local state using the array spread operator. Additionally, you'll learn how to delete any item we like using the filter function in JavaScript.

This project will also get you familiar with typing values into a form input and then retrieving those values when the form is submitted. You'll do this using the onSubmit event handler.

One fun way to enhance this project would be to enable our users to double click each item in our list to strike through it to put a line through it in addition to being able to delete it.
